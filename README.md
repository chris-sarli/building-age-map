# How old is Providence?

This is a map of parcels in Providence, stylized by the year of last building construction. All of the data comes from [the City's GIS Portal.](https://webgis.providenceri.gov/server/rest/services/Tax/Parcels/MapServer) This visualization was inspired by Kyril Negoda's [How old is Minneapolis?](https://spatialthinking.tumblr.com/post/160598058069/minneapolis-building-age-zoomable-version-mapping)

Hovering on a parcel reveals the year, and clicking on it will open the relevant entry in [Vision.](https://gis.vgsi.com/providenceri/)

This project is very rough and will (hopefully) see some more updates in the future.
